# This script is a wrapper around mythburn.py, which does most of the work
# for mytharchive.
# I prefer to use it rather than mytharchive, because that way, I can still
# watch recording with mythfrontend while this script is busy prepping files
# to burn to DVD.
# It assumes you have set up a mytharchive job file,
# $MYTHARCHIVETMP/config/mydata.xml
# This is a file that mytharchive uses to tell mythburn.py what recordings
# and videos you want to burn to DVD.
# If you've ever burned a DVD, you probably have such a file in your
# "Myth Archive Temp Directory."

# Please note the options attributes in my example job file, mydata.xml
# I have added another attribute, rundvdauthor="0"
# You won't find rundvdauthor in a job file created by mytharchive
# It is recognized by my version of mythburn.py,
# and tells it not to execute dvdauthor.
# That saves us some time in processing because this script will run dvdauthor
# after adding subtitles to the final.mpg files.
# I have included patches for mythburn.py, one for 0.20.2 and one for 0.21.

# If you're not comfortable editing $MYHTARCHIVETMP/config/mydata.xml by hand,
# another option is to go ahead and use mytharchive to create the job file,
# then run this script after mytharchive is done.
# If you do, be sure to disable the options "Create ISO" and "Burn DVD"
# in the last MythArchive screen.

# MYTHARCHIVETMP should be set to the value of your "Myth Archive Temp Directory."
# It is the first option on page 1 of MythArchive Settings.
# The configure script should have set this.

# The following variable determines whether to run tweakdvdxml.py
# tweakdvdxml.py does some postprocessing on the dvdauthor.xml script
# created by mythburn. It puts all the titles into one titleset, and tells
# a dvd player to play titles one after another,
# instead of going back to the main menu after playing each title.
# It also moves the main menu from root menu to the titleset.
# That's because it's most convenient with my universal remote.
# I have only tested tweakdvdxml.py with dvdauthor.xml files created with
# my own theme, mytheme, so this value is only true if theme="mytheme".
# However, it may work with the Compact theme.
