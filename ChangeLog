2009-06-17  Helen Buus  <mythtv@hbuus.com>

	* Release 0.6.

	* Added mythsubtitles, an alternative to cc2subtitles.
	  Mythsubtitles supports more media file formats than cc2subtitles,
	  but requires that mythtv source be installed and built.
	* Added stripivtv, a utility that strips the private data stream
	  containing VBI data from recordings captured by the ivtv and cx18
	  drivers.
	* Added mytranscode, a shell script that transcodes ATSC/QAM recordings
	  into NTSC DVD compatible format.
	* Fixed problems compiling on 64 bit platform and regression tested
	  on 32 bit platform.

	* Release 0.5.

	* Use timestamps from video stream instead of ivtv's VBI stream.
	  Seems that ivtv 1.1.0 doesn't provide valid timestamps, unlike
	  ivtv 1.0.0.
	* Added mythburn patch for mythtv 0.21.
	  Tested with mythtv-0.21.0+fixes18207.
	* Added libzvbi patch to fix occasional core dump.
	  Tested with zvbi-0.2.31, but problem was there in older versions.
	* Added options to use fifos and create ISO.
	* If MYTHARCHIVEDIR or MYTHARCHIVETMP don't exist, it's now a warning
	  instead of an error. This makes it easier to use cc2subtitles when
	  MythTv is not installed.
	* Added decodempeg, an MPEG2 decoder.

	* vbi.cpp, vbi.h: Better results for scrolling CCs.
	  Tested with zvbi-0.2.29.
	* myburn.in: Don't terminate if tweakdvdxml.py fails.
	  Check mediatype & erasedvdrw, if set, tell
	  tell growisofs to -use-the-force-luke.
