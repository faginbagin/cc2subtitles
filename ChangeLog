2012-12-08  Helen Buus  <mythtv@hbuus.com>

	* Release 0.10.

	* Modified to work with personal 0.23 version of mythtv patched with
	  0.25 fixes for closed captions.
	* Added support for cut lists, but only for recordings made from
          digital inputs (e.g. ATSC or clear QAM) where CC data is embedded
          in the video stream. Will not work for analog recordings (e.g. NTSC).
        * Added libzvbi-0.2.33.patch which fixes compile issues and display of
          closed captions containing a mix of normal and italic text.

2010-12-28  Helen Buus  <mythtv@hbuus.com>

	* Release 0.9.

2009-06-17  Helen Buus  <mythtv@hbuus.com>

	* Release 0.6.

	* Added mythsubtitles, an alternative to cc2subtitles.
	  Mythsubtitles supports more media file formats than cc2subtitles,
	  but requires that mythtv source be installed and built.
	* Added stripivtv, a utility that strips the private data stream
	  containing VBI data from recordings captured by the ivtv and cx18
	  drivers.
	* Added mytranscode, a shell script that transcodes ATSC/QAM recordings
	  into NTSC DVD compatible format.
	* Fixed problems compiling on 64 bit platform and regression tested
	  on 32 bit platform.

2009-02-02  Helen Buus  <mythtv@hbuus.com>

	* Release 0.5.

	* Use timestamps from video stream instead of ivtv's VBI stream.
	  Seems that ivtv 1.1.0 doesn't provide valid timestamps, unlike
	  ivtv 1.0.0.
	* Added mythburn patch for mythtv 0.21.
	  Tested with mythtv-0.21.0+fixes18207.
	* Added libzvbi patch to fix occasional core dump.
	  Tested with zvbi-0.2.31, but problem was there in older versions.
	* Added options to use fifos and create ISO.
	* If MYTHARCHIVEDIR or MYTHARCHIVETMP don't exist, it's now a warning
	  instead of an error. This makes it easier to use cc2subtitles when
	  MythTv is not installed.
	* Added decodempeg, an MPEG2 decoder.

	* vbi.cpp, vbi.h: Better results for scrolling CCs.
	  Tested with zvbi-0.2.29.

	  Check mediatype & erasedvdrw, if set, tell
	  tell growisofs to -use-the-force-luke.
	* tweakdvdxml.py.in: Leave pgcs in menus alone.
