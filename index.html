cc2subtitles - Convert NTSC closed captions (or PAL Teletext?) to DVD subtitles
</h2>
<hr>
<b>cc2subtitles</b> is a solution for the one feature I wanted that MythTV didn't
provide "out of the box."
Namely, the ability to burn recordings to DVDs with closed captions.
<p>
Here are some details that should help you decide whether <b>cc2subtitles</b> might be useful to you:
<ul>
<li>
It only works with recordings made with the IVTV driver, the one used by Hauppauge analog cards.
FWIW, I have a PVR-150.
<li>
It uses a library called
<a href="http://zapping.sourceforge.net/doc/libzvbi/">libzvbi</a>
(also known as <i>ZVBI - VBI Decoding Library</i>).
libzvbi is part of the <a href="http://zapping.sourceforge.net/">Zapping</a>
project, a TV viewer for the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> desktop.
libzvbi is available as a debian package in the debian and ubuntu repositories, and probably many other repositories, too.
<li>
libzvbi supports PAL/SECAM Teletext, probably better than NTSC CC,
so there's a good chance my little utility will work with Teletext, too.
I haven't tested it, but would be willing to,
if I can get a hold of some PAL recordings that have VBI data.
Or, perhaps someone else in PAL land would like to do the work?
<li>
It converts IVTV encoded VBI data into DVD subtitles.
It takes advantage of the fact that libzvbi can produce .png renderings of CC/Teletext.
It then uses spumux (part of dvdauthor) to convert the .png files
into DVD subtitles.
I think the results are better than other solutions that use spumux to encode text based subtitles.
The results look like what you're used to seeing on your TV,
including support for italics and special characters used in Spanish & French,
as well as the musical note.
Plus, it supports closed caption colors.
<br>
<i>Note: getting special characters requires a <a href="#libzvbi.patch">patch for libzvbi</a>.</i>
<li>
I'm pretty sure it won't work if you like to cut commercials out of your recordings.
That's because of the timestamp data I use to figure out where to add subtitles to recordings.
I've worked around this problem by patching mytharchive's script, mythburn.py,
to add chapter marks at the commercial marks found by mythcommflag.
</ul>
Here are a couple of example screen snapshots:
<p>
<img src="images/NotDancing-sub.jpg" width=640 height=480 align=ABSCENTER>
<p>
The above snapshot demonstrates:
<ul>
<li>
that CC subtitles are positioned the same as CCs
would be on your screen, not simply fixed to the bottom of the screen.
<li>
that italics are supported. In this case, italics are used to indicate an off screen speaker.
</ul>
<p>
<img src="images/Spanish-sub.jpg" width=640 height=480 align=ABSCENTER>
<p>
The above snapshot demostrates that Spanish characters are supported.
<br>
<i>Note: requires <a href="#libzvbi.patch">patch for libzvbi</a>.</i>
<br>
You may be wondering if the captions are clipped if you view a 4:3 recording
in 16:9 mode. 
They should not be clipped as long as you tell your DVD player to stretch the
image vertically, rather than just using your wide screen TV's aspect ratio
settings.
For example, I set my Panasonic wide screen TV to full screen (not zoom)
and use my Panasonic DVD player's Display menu to set "4:3 aspect" to Zoom.
With these settings, subtitles are not clipped.
<p>
If you are comfortable compiling source and installing the results by hand
without benefit of a configure script, you're welcome to give it a try now.

<p>
Right now, there's just a simple Makefile that compiles <b>cc2subtitles</b>.
It doesn't even have an install rule.
<p>
In the near future, I expect to provide something that's more "turnkey,"
something a non-developer can easily use.
But first I'll need to figure out how to use automake/configure and perhaps how to generate a binary debian package.

<h3>
Installation instructions
</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Install libzvbi (without patch)
<dd>
<p>
Before you can build <b>cc2subtitles</b>,
you must either install binary libzvbi development packages
or install and build the source package with
<a href="#libzvbi.patch">libzvbi.patch</a>.
The necessary binary packages are available in both Debian and Ubuntu repositories,
and probably most other distributions.
On Debian and Ubuntu, use your favorite package
installation tool and install <b>libzvbi-dev</b>.
For example:
<pre>
# apt-get libzvbi-dev
</pre>
This should install the development header files as well as the runtime library.
<p>
<dt>Install libzvbi (with patch)
<dd>
<p>
You don't have to use my libzvbi.patch. But you may want to. See
<a href="#libzvbi.patch">libzvbi.patch</a>
for information about the patch.
<p>
<i>
Note: These instructions are minimal and apply to Debian based distributions, only.
The web is full of more detailed information on how to build source packages,
not only for Debian based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu), but others, too.
</i>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Install and compile the source package, <b>zvbi</b>:
<pre>
# apt-get --compile source zvbi
</pre>
<code>apt-get --compile</code> will first patch and configure the source
so that, when it is compiled,
the results will be the same as the binary package.
<p>
<li>
Patch the source.
<pre>
# cd zvbi-0.2.25
# patch -p1 < <i>path-to-cc2subtitles</i>/libzvbi.patch
</pre>
<li>
Recompile and install
<pre>
# make install
</pre>
</ol>
<dt>
Install cc2subtitles
<dd>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Download, unpack and make cc2subtitles
<pre>
# wget http://www.hbuus.com/cc2subtitles-0.1.tar.gz
# tar xf cc2subtitles-0.1.tar.gz
# cd cc2subtitles
# make
</pre>

<li>
Install or add to your PATH
<p>
Personally, I find it easiest to add the cc2subtitles directory to my PATH.
For example, add the following line to your profile:
<pre>
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/cc2subtitles
</pre>
The next time you login, cc2subtitles will be in your PATH.
If you don't want to logout and login,
you can execute the above command in your current login shell.
</ol>
<p>

<dt>
Configure mytharchive
<dd>
<p>
Because of the way the myburn script works with mytharchive and mythburn.py, 
you need to disable "Use FIFOs" in MythArchive Settings.
MythArchive Settings are found in mythfrontend:
<p>
Utilities/Setup -> Setup -> Media Settings -> Archive Files Settings
<p>
"Use FIFOs" is the 4th option on Page 2.
<p>
If you don't do this, the myburn script will fail when it tries to execute spumux to add the closed captions.
Be aware that disabling the use of FIFOs will mean you'll use more
disk space to create DVDs than before.
<p>
A future enhancement might be to integrate the execution of cc2subtitles
and spumux into mythburn.py.
That would certainly reduce the disk space requirements.
<dl>
<dd>
<p>
<font size="-1">
I wonder how much effort should be put into this project.
Given the fact that analog TV broadcasts will stop next year,
the question has to be asked, just how long will cc2subtitles be useful?
When we go digital, closed captions should be embedded in the
MPEG video stream according to well defined standards.
I believe closed caption data in video streams should be preserved,
so long as no lossy transcoding is done.
That's one reason why I haven't tried to integrate it into
mytharchive's mythburn.py.
<p>
Another reason is the fact that I'm currently using mythtv 0.20.2.
Version 0.21 is soon to be released.
I don't know if the 0.21 version of mythburn.py has changed much.
<p>
I have patched mythburn.py, but I feel that all but one of my changes
have value regardless of the need to preserve analog closed captions.
After mythtv 0.21 is released, I will check it out and see whether
my issues have been addressed.
If not, I will try to get my changes accepted by mythtv development.

<p>
You will need to change the values of some variables in this bash script
to match your environment and preferences.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>
<code>
MYTHARCHIVETMP
</code>
<dd>
Change the value to your <code>Myth Archive Temp Directory</code>, one of the
<code>MythArchive Settings</code> found in mythfrontend:

</pre>
<p>
<dt>
<code>
MYTHARCHIVEDIR
</code>
<dd>
Set the value to the directory where the mytharchive plugin is installed.
are installed.
This variable is currently set twice in the script.
The first value is the default directory for Debian based distributions:
<pre>
MYTHARCHIVEDIR=/usr/share/mythtv/mytharchive
</pre>
The second value is the directory where I have installed my modifications.
<pre>
MYTHARCHIVEDIR=$HOME/build/share/mythtv/mytharchive
</pre>
It should be sufficient to simply comment out the second value.
If you don't comment it out, the second value wins.
<p>
<dt>
<code>
RUNTWEAKDVDXML
</code>
<dd>
Set the value to <code>true</code> if you want to execute tweakdvdxml.py.
Set the value to <code>false</code> if you DON'T want to execute tweakdvdxml.py.
See <a href="#tweakdvdxml.py">tweakdvdxml.py</a> for information.
<p>
<dt>
<code>
DEVDVD
</code>
<dd>
Set the value to the name of your DVD device.
Mine is /dev/dvd1
</dl>
<p>

<dt>
Patch mythburn.py
<dd>
<p>
To apply the patch, execute one of the following commands.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
If you have the mythplugins source installed:
<pre>
# patch -d <i>path-to-mythplugins-source</i> -p1 -b < mythburn.patch
</pre>
<li>
If you do not have the mythplugins source installed:
<pre>
# patch -d <i>path-to-mytharchive-installdir</i> -p3 -b < mythburn.patch
</pre>
where <code><i>path-to-mytharchive-installdir</i></code> is the same value
you used for <code>MYTHARCHIVEDIR</code> in the myburn script.
</ul>
<p>
<i>
Note: it is not absolutely essential to apply this patch.
But if you don't, you will have problems if you alternate between
using myburn and mytharchive to burn DVDs.
See <a href="#mythburn.patch">mythburn.patch</a> for more information
and work arounds.
</i>
<p>

<dt>
Burn a DVD
<dd>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Create or edit the job file, $MYTHARCHIVETMP/config/mydata.xml.
<br>
I provide an example and a detailed explanation: 
<a href="#mydata.xml">mydata.xml</a>.
<p>
If you are not comfortable editing the file, you can use the mytharchive
plugin to do it.
Just be aware that this will mean your computer will duplicate effort
on some time consuming tasks.
Be sure you disable the "Create ISO" and "Burn DVD" options.
<p>
<li>
Insert blank or rewritable media into your burner.
<p>
<li>
Execute myburn.
Since this is such a time consuming process,
I like to run it in the background, capturing the output to examine later.
I also like to use nohup since I ususally run it in an ssh login session.
Using nohup means I can logout and login later to check the results.
So, I use this command:
<pre>
$ nohup myburn &
</pre>
The output will be in the file, nohup.out, in the current directory.
I can check the progress with this command:
<pre>
$ grep myburn nohup.out
</pre>
Here's example output from a successful burn:
<pre>

More Details
</h3>

<h4>
<a name="cc2subtitles">
cc2subtitles
</h4>
An executable that reads a TV recording and renders NTSC closed captions (and possibly PAL/SECAM Teletext) as .png (Portable Network Graphics) image files.
<p>
If the recording contains VBI data encoded by the IVTV driver,
cc2subtitles will feed the data to the libzvbi library to render closed captions
as .png images.
For each image file, cc2subtitles adds a record to an XML file that
specifies a start and end time when the image should be displayed
during playback.
The default file name is spumux.xml.
spumux.xml can be read by spumux (part of dvdauthor), which converts
the images into DVD subtitles and embeds them in an MPEG2 file.
cc2subtitles also adds XML comment tags containing the closed caption text
in spumux.xml.
<p>
If no closed captions are found in the TV recording, cc2subtitles wil remove spumux.xml and exit with a non-zero code.
<h4>
<a name="myburn">
myburn
</h4>
This bash script is a wrapper around mythburn.py, which does most of the work
for mytharchive, as well as cc2subtitles.
I prefer to use it from the command line rather than mytharchive,
because I can still watch recordings with mythfrontend while
this script is busy prepping files to burn to DVD.
It assumes you have set up a mytharchive job file,
<code>$MYTHARCHIVETMP/config/mydata.xml</code>
The job file is a file that mytharchive creates to tell mythburn what
recordings and videos you want to burn to DVD.
<p>
<b>myburn</b> automates the process of:
<ol>
<li>
transcoding, demuxing, and remuxing recordings and videos into a DVD compatible format.
<li>
creating DVD menus and an XML file
(dvdauthor.xml)
that tells dvdauthor how to assemble the desired DVD file system.
<li>
tweaking dvdauthor.xml to match my personal tastes, using tweakdvdxml.py
<li>
for each recording:
<ol type="a">
<li>
executing cc2subtitles to render closed captions as images and create spumux.xml.
<li>
executing spumux to convert the images into subtitles and embedding them into a new mpeg file.
</ol>
<li>
executing dvdauthor to create the DVD file system.
<li>
executing mkisofs to convert the DVD file system into an ISO image.
<li>
executing growisofs to burn the ISO image onto DVD.
</ol>
The mytharchive script, mythburn.py, normally does all but steps 3 and 4.
<p>
You will need to edit myburn to match your environment and preferences.

<h4>
<a name="mydata.xml">
mydata.xml
</h4>
An example mytharchive job file.
<p>
When you use mytharchive to burn DVDs, it creates the job file,
<code>$MYTHARCHIVETMP/config/mydata.xml</code>.
The job file is the way mytharchive tells it's helper script, mythburn.py, what recordings and videos you want to burn to DVD.
The file also stores the choices you make on whether to create an ISO image
or to burn a DVD. Here's a copy of the example:
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE mythburn>
&lt;mythburn>
    &lt;job theme="mytheme" >
        &lt;media>

	    &lt;!-- The following line is for a recording made by mythtv (Note the short file name) -->
            &lt;file usecutlist="0" type="recording" encodingprofile="NONE" filename="1007_20080217185500.mpg" />

	    &lt;!-- The following line is for a DVD VOB imported by mythdvd, (Note the full path name) -->
            &lt;file usecutlist="0" type="video" encodingprofile="NONE" filename="/video/mythtv/video/07-06-23-Swim.vob" />

        &lt;/media>

	&lt;!-- The following line defines option values, I added rundvdauthor="0" -->
        &lt;options rundvdauthor="0" dvdrsize="4482" mediatype="0" erasedvdrw="0" createiso="0" doburn="0" savefilename="" />
    &lt;/job>
&lt;/mythburn>
</pre>
<dl>
<dt>
<code>&lt;file></code> elements
<dd>
<p>
For each recording you select,
there will be a <code>&lt;file></code> element
with <code>type="recording"</code> indicating that the file is a recording.
The filename attribute is relative to the recording directory.
At least it is in 0.20.2. I don't know if it's the full path name in SVN
with the storage group feature.
In my case, the file, <code>1007_20080217185500.mpg</code> can be found in
<code>/video/mythtv/recordings</code> where <code>/video/mythtv</code> is
my storage directory and <code>recordings</code> is the subdirectory that
contains recordings made by mythtv.
I can usually figure out what recording I want by listing the contents of
the directory.
The file names are formatted as follows:
<code>tuner#channel#_YYYYMMDDhhmmss.mpg</code>.
In this case:
<br>
<code>tuner#</code> is 1.
<br>
<code>channel#</code> is 007.
<br>
<code>YYYY</code> is 2008.
<br>
<code>MM</code> is 02.
<br>
<code>DD</code> is 17.
<br>
<code>hh</code> is 18.
<br>
<code>mm</code> is 55.
<br>
<code>ss</code> is 00.
<br>
In other words, the recording was made on tuner 1, channel 7, on February 17, 2008 at 18:55:00 (6:55 PM).
<p>
For each video you select,
there will be a <code>&lt;file></code> element
with <code>type="video"</code> indicating that the file is an imported video.
The filename attribute is the full path name of the imported video file.
You can see from this example that my storage directory is
<code>/video/mythtv</code> and imported videos are stored in the
<code>video</code> subdirectory.
<p>
The other attributes apply to both recordings and videos:
<dl>
<dt>
<code>usecutlist</code>
<dd>
must be set to 0, because cc2subtitles doesn't know about cut lists.
If you set usecutlist to 1, CC subtitles will not be in sync with your
video and audio.
<dt>
<code>encodingprofile</code>
<dd>
can be HQ, SP, LP or EP, or it can be NONE, if you don't want mythburn.py
to re-encode your recordings or videos.
</dl>
<dt>
<p>
<code>&lt;option></code> element
<dd>
<p>
There should be only one <code>&lt;option></code> element.

<dl>
<dt> <code>rundvdauthor</code> <dd>
I added support for this option to mythburn.py.
If you use 
<a href="#mythburn.patch">mythburn.patch</a>,
setting this attribute to 0 will tell mythburn.py NOT to run dvdauthor.
This will save time because the myburn script will run dvdauthor after it adds
CC subtitles to the final DVD titles.

<dt> <code>dvdrsize</code> <dd>
This attribute specifies the capacity of the DVD media.
For single layer DVDs (including RW media), the value should be 4482.
For dual layer DVDs, the value should be 8964.

<dt> <code>mediatype</code> <dd>
This attribute specifies the media type.
<ol compact start=0>
<li>
single layer DVD
<li>
dual layer DVD
<li>
DVD +/- RW
<li>
file
</ol>

<dt> <code>erasedvdrw</code> <dd>
This attribute applies to DVD +/- RW media.
If you want growisofs to first erase the DVD, set this attribute to 1.
Otherwise, set it to 0.
<br>
<i>Future enhancement: modify myburn to check this attribute and pass it on to growisofs.</i>

<dt> <code>createiso</code> <dd>
Must be set to 0 so mythburn.py doesn't waste time and disk space
creating the ISO that myburn will create later.

<dt> <code>doburn</code> <dd>
Must be set to 0 so mythburn.py does not try to burn the DVD that
myburn will burn later.

<dt> <code>savefilename</code> <dd>
As long as createiso is 0, this attribute has no effect.
Leav it as the null string.

</dl>

</dl>

<h4>
<a name="mythburn.patch">
mythburn.patch
</h4>
My patch for mythburn.py,
the mytharchive script that does most of the work of burning DVDs.
It patches the script that comes with mythplugins-0.20.2.
I do not know if my patch will apply cleanly to an SVN version.
If you try it with SVN, please let me know whether the patch applies cleanly and
whether the script still works after patching.
<p>
I changed the script as follows:
<ol>
<li>
It adds support for an option to NOT run dvdauthor.
The option is specified in the mytharchive job file by adding the attribute:
<code>rundvdauthor="0"</code>
to the options element.
See 
<a href="#mydata.xml">mydata.xml</a>
for an example.
Since dvdauthor has to be run after cc2subtitles and spumux,
telling mythburn.py to not run dvdauthor reduces the time it takes
to prepare and burn a DVD.
<li>
It creates chapter marks at transitions to/from commercials.
The original creates chapters at fixed 5 minute intervals.
<li>
It fixes a problem that prevents mytharchive from creating DVDs after
myburn has been used.
mythburn.py would terminate when it couldn't clean up working directories
left over from an earlier run of myburn.
That's because myburn creates subdirectories for cc2subtitles to store the
CC image files.
The fix was to change mythburn.py's deleteAllFilesInFolder function
to remove subdirectories as well as files.
<li>
Personally, I find the intro menu an annoying waste of time.
But when I tried my own theme with no intro,
my Panasonic DVD player would not play the menus at all.
So I found the cause and fixed it.
<li>
I changed how recording times are formatted on menus that display recording times.
Originally, mythburn.py used the start time of a program,
not the time when the recording started,
and it didn't display when the program or recording ended.
So, you couldn't tell, looking at the menu, how long any title runs.
I changed it to display when recording started and ended.
</ol>
If you do not apply this patch, and want to switch between using mytharchive
and myburn, you may need to work around problem 3.
<p>
If you don't intend to use myburn after mytharchive fills in the job file,
mydata.xml,
you will need to execute the following command before you use mytharchive:
<pre>
# rm -rf <i>path-to-mytharchive-tempdir</i>/work
</pre>
where <code><i>path-to-mytharchive-tempdir</i></code> is the same value
you used for <code>MYTHARCHIVETMP</code> in the myburn script.
<p>
If the reason you want to use mytharchive is to fill in the job file,
mydata.xml, and you still want to use myburn to add CC subtitles,
you just need to run myburn after mytharchive terminates.
Be sure you disable the "Create ISO" and "Burn DVD" options.
<h4>
<a name="tweakdvdxml.py">
tweakdvdxml.py
</h4>
A script that tweaks dvdauthor.xml to my taste.
tweakdvdxml.py does some postprocessing on the dvdauthor.xml script
created by mythburn.py:
<ul>
<li>
It puts all the titles into one titleset.
<li>
It makes sure languages are specified for the audio and subtitle tracks.
If no language is specified by mythburn.py (and it isn't in 0.20.2),
tweakdvdxml.py will use the value of the LANG environment variable.
If LANG is unset, it sets the audio and subtitle languages to English.
There is also a command line option to override the default.
<li>
It tells a dvd player to play titles one after another,
instead of going back to the main menu after playing each title.
<li>
It moves the main menu from the root menu to the titleset menu.
That's because it's most convenient with my universal remote.
</ul>
I have only tested this script with dvdauthor.xml files created with
my own theme.
So far, I have found one problem with it.
If you burn a DVD with both TV recordings and imported videos,
you may not have sound when you play back some titles.
It depends on whether the imported videos use the same audio format as the TV recordings.
If they're different, you'll lose sound in the titles that have a different audio format than the first title.
If they're the same, all should be well.
<p>
Some suggestions:
<ol>
<li>
Don't burn DVDs with a mix of TV recordings and imported videos.
<li>
Rerun dvdauthor with the untweaked dvdauthor_orig.xml, e.g.:
<pre>
dvdauthor -x $MYTHARCHIVETMP/work/dvdauthor_orig.xml
</pre>
<li>
Disable tweakdvdxml.py by setting:
<pre>
RUNTWEAKDVDXML=false
</pre>
in myburn.
</ol>

This patch addresses two issues with the current release of libzvbi, 0.2.25.
<ul>
<li>
